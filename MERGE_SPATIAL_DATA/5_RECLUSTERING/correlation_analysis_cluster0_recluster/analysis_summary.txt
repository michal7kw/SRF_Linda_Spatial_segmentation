Key Insights:
- This analysis performs cluster 0 reclustering on ALL cluster 0 cells combined across samples
- Enables identification of shared and sample-specific subclusters within cluster 0
- Provides comprehensive cross-sample comparisons and marker gene analysis
- Sample composition analysis reveals cluster distribution patterns across samples

Notes:
- Individual sample analyses are available in the per-sample output directories
- This combined analysis complements the individual sample analyses
- Cluster 0 subclusters identified here represent shared patterns across all samples
