ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY:
1. Loaded merged dataset with all samples and clusters
2. Calculated mean gene expression per cluster across entire dataset
3. Performed hierarchical clustering using correlation distance and Ward linkage
4. Computed sample contribution percentages for each cluster
5. Created dendrogram visualization with color-coded sample contribution bars
6. Generated sample contribution heatmap showing cluster composition
7. Produced summary statistics and detailed data exports

INTERPRETATION GUIDELINES:
- The dendrogram shows similarity relationships between clusters based on gene expression
- Sample contribution bars show what percentage of each cluster comes from each sample
- Clusters with high diversity (multiple samples contributing) may represent common cell types
- Clusters dominated by single samples may represent sample-specific populations
- The correlation distance metric emphasizes gene expression pattern similarity
